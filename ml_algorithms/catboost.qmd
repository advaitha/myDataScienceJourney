# Catboost

* CatBoost introduces three major modifications to classical Newton Boosting approach
    * It is specialized to categorical features
    * It uses ordered boosting as its underlying approach which allows it to address data leakage and prediction shift
    * It uses oblivious decision trees as base estimators which often leads to faster training times
