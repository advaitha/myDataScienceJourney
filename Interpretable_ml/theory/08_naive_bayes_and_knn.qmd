## Naive Bayes
* Based on Bayes conditional probabilities
* Strong assumption of conditional independence of features
![Naive Bayes](/Images/naive_bayes.png)
* It is an interpretable model because of the independence of assumption

## K-Nearest Neighbors
* The tricky part is finding the right K and how to measure the distance between instances
* There are no parameters to learn, so no interpretability on a modular level
* No global interpretability
* Local interpretation depends on the number of features in a data instance. If the features are less then it can give good explanations.
