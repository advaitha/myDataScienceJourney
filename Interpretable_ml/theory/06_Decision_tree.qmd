# Decision Trees

### Feature Importance
* The number of splits for which a feature was used and measure how much it has reduced the variance or gini index compared to the parent node. The sum of all importances is scaled to 100.

### Disadvantages
* Trees fail to deal with linear relationships
* Slight changes in input can have a big impact on outcome - Lack of smoothness
* Trees are unstable. A few changes in the training data can create a completely different tree
* The number of terminal nodes increases quickly with depth
