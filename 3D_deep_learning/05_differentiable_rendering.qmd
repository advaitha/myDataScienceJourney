# Differentiable Rendering

The physical process of image formation is a mapping from 3D models to 2D images.

Many 3D computer vision problems are a reversal of image formation. In these problems, we are usually given 2D images and need to estimate the 3D models from the 2D images.

we can cast this as an optimization problem. We can minimize the distance between rendered image and the original image. To do this the rendering should be differentiable.

## Making rendering differentiable
