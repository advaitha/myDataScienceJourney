# Feature Store

Feature store is an interface between models and the data.

* Productionize new features
* Automate feature computation, backfills, logging
* Share and reuse feature pipelines across teams
* Consistency between training and serving data

1. **Serving** - Avoid Training-serving skew

2. **Storage** - Offline and online storage. Data lake is extended for offline storage. Online storage use latest feature values for each entity. Redis, DynamoDB or Cassandra is used for online storage.

3. **Transformation** - Regular processing of new data into feature values. Feature stores both manage and orchestrate data transformations that produce these values, as well as ingest values produced by external systems.

4. **Monitoring** - Data quality is tracked by monitoring for drift, training-serving skew etc.


5. **Registry** - A registry of standardized feature definitions and metadata. It is a common catalog to explore, develop, collaborate and publish new definitions within and across teams.
