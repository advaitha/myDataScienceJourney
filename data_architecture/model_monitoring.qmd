# Model Monitoring

## Data Drift 
* Also called feature drift
* The population on which the model inference is performed shifts

Examples:-

* Increase exposure to one particular marketing channel which you haven't had enough exposure to before
* Moving to new markets etc.


## Concept Drift
* The functional relationship between model inputs and outputs change.

Example:-

* Change in housing prices with change in economic situation
