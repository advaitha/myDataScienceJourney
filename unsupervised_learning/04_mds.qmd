# Multi Dimensional Scaling
* This is a non-parametric method
*  Arrange the points in 2D such that the pairwise distance between them are preserved  
* The loss function for MDS is reducing the original distance between two points in the dataset and the distance between points after arranging the points in 2D
* ![MDS Loss function](/Images/loss_function_lds.png)
* It is difficult to MDS for large datasets as it considers pairwise distances between all points. (Quadratic complexity for memory)
* It is hard to scale MDS for large datasets

## Why MDS does not perform well
* <span id="highlighted-line">Trying to preserve distances in high-dimensions in low dimensions is not a good idea (curse of dimensionality)</span>
* As the number of dimensions increases, the mean of the pairwise distances will also increase and we will not find pairwise distances which are closer to zero
* For example, in the below image we are trying to fit the data with green distribution to blue distribution (which is difficult)
