The gradients of the outer layers are large compared to the gradients of the inner layers. A high learning rate is suitable for the inner layers and low learning rate would suit the outer layers. Also the gradients are not centered around zero which is not good for a neural network."

The neurons whose activation is zero will not propogate the gradients and hence will not get updated. They are considered as dead neurons. Two ways to deal with this are to use higher learning rates  or use a bias value which will avoid getting zero after activation. (Read about these methods). In practice RELU is the most commonly used activation function."
