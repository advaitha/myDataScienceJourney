# Step by Step Guide for System Design

## Step 1 - Understand the problem and establish design scope (5 mins)
* Ask as many questions as possible to understand the problem
    * Clarify the requirements
    * Prority of the features to build
    * Focus on non-fuctional requirements like scale and performance
    * Do rough back of the envelope calculations
* By the end of this step we should have a clear understanding of the requirements and non fuctional features 


## Step 2 - Propose high level design and get buy-in (20 mins)
* Use Top-down approach 
* start with API Design and see if the APIs are satisfying the functional requirements. Do not consider APIs which are not aligned to the requirements.
    * Input parameters
    * Output responses 
* Start high-level design once the APIs are finalized.
* Review if all the features are covered in the high-level design

## Step 3 - Design Deep dive (15 mins)
* Identify areas with challenges and discuss at least two options with their tradeoffs
* Pick a solution and discuss 

## Step 4 - Wrap up (5 mins)
* Summarize the design
* Focus on the parts which are unique to the situation
