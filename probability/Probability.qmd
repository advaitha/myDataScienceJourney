# Probability

* probability = preferred events / All events
* Union is similar to 'OR' condition 
* Intersection is similar to 'AND' condition 
* Probability of getting event A or B is
	* P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)   
	* We are subtracting P (A and B) because some elements will be common to both A and B and we will be double counting them. So we subtract P (A and B) to eleminate the double count
* We can use Venn diagram to draw intersections, mutually exclusive probabilities etc. Venn diagrams can't be used for conditional probabillity or to show dependence
* We can use tree diagrams to visualize conditional probability and dependence
* Probability of A given B - P(A | B)

* If two probabilities are independent then:
	* P(A|B) = P(A)  because A and B are independent and A does not depend on occurance of B, we can use this expression to check if two events are independent
	* P( A and B) = P(A|B)* P(B)  as P(A|B) = P(A)
	* P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) -  when two events are independent then we need to multiply their probabilities
	* If two probabilities are independent then they are not mutually exclusive. If probabilities are mutually exclusive then they are not independent
* Mutually exclusive events - Add the probabilities - P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B)  because P(A and B) will be zero


# Bayes Thereom
* When we are provided information about a conditional probability eg P(A|B) and if we need to find the conditional probability P(B|A) then we should use Bayes theorem
