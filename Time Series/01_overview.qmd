# Time Series Introduction
* Time series analysis often comes down to the question of causality: How did the past influence the future?
* ![steps to take care](../Images/time_series.png)

### Timestamp troubles
* what process generated the timestamp, how and when
* Time zone information
* Record your own actions and see how they are captured
* Local or universal time

### Filling missing values
* Forward fill
* Moving average of past values - use only the data that occurred before the missing data point
* Interpolation - Determining the values of missing points based on geometric constraints regarding how we want the overall data to behave


### Upsampling and downsampling
* To match the frequency of different time series data
* We either increase or decrease the timestamp frequency

#### Downsampling the data
* The original resolution of the data isn't sensible
* Match against data at a lower frequency - we can either downsample, take average, weighted mean etc.
* Selecting out every nth element

#### Upsampling the data
* convert irregularly sampled time series to a regularly timed one
* Inputs sampled at different frequencies
* Knowledge of time series dynamics - Treat as a missing data problem and missing data techniques can be applied.

#### Smoothing data
* Moving average is used to eliminate measurement spikes, errors of measurement etc.

* **purpose of smoothing**
* Data preparation - Raw data unsuitable
* Feature generation
* Prediction - For many processes prediction is mean, which we get from a smoothed feature
* Visualization - Add signal to a noisy plot

* Exponential smoothing - All data points are not treated equally
* More weight to recent data
* ![Equation for exponential smoothing](/Images/exponential_smoothing.png)
* ![Doing smoothing with pandas](/Images/smoothing_pandas.png)
* Exponential smoothing does not perform well in case of data with a long-term trend
* Holt's method and holt-winters smoothing are two exponential smoothing methods applied to data with a trend or with a trend and a seasonality
* Kalman filters and LOESS(locally estimated scatter plot smoothing) are other computationally involved methods - These methods leak information from the future - Not appropriate for forecasting
* Smoothing is a commonly used form of forecasting, and you can use a smoothed time series (without lookahead) as one easy null model when you are testing whether a fancier method is actually producing a successful forecast

## Seasonality
*  Seasonal time series are time series in which behaviors recur over a fixed period. There can be multiple periodicities reflecting different tempos of seasonality, such as the seasonality of the 24-hour day versus the 12-month calendar season, both of which exhibit strong features in most time series relating to human behavior.


## Time Zones 
* Python libraries to deal with Timezone - datetime, pytz and dateutil

* Be careful with timezone conversions
* Dealing with daylight savings can be tricky


### Lookahead
* Processing and cleaning time-related data can be a tedious and detail-oriented process.There is tremendous danger in data cleaning and processing of introducing a lookahead! You should have lookaheads only if they are intentional, and this is rarely appropriate.
