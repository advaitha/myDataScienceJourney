## Data labelling
`Snort` and `Suricata` tools were used for data labelling

## Feature selection

## Training methods
Two ML models were used for training.
Ensemble method (Bagging) with base classifier as naive Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression and SVM.
The flow features were converted to a 32X32 matrix and a CNN model was developed.

## Results
CNN model was performing better than ensemble method. 

## Tradeoff
The tradeoff between them is the complexity and the training time involved.
CNN requires more computation resources and is an offline model.
