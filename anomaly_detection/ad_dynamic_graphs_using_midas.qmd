# Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs using MIDAS-R

Real world networks are dynamic in nature and are constantly changing.

Contributions of Midas:-

    * Streaming approach
    * Theoretical Gurantee
    * Effectiveness

Microcluster based detector of anomalies in Edge streams (MIDAS) performs detections by considering the `temporal nature of the networks` and by considering `micro-clusters instead of individual edges`.

## MIDAS considers Temporal nature

Static graphs do not capture the temporal relations.


## MIDAS considers micro-clusters instead of individual edges

![Burst in activity](/Images/burst_activity.png)

MIDAS monitors suddenly appearing bursts of activity sharing several nodes or edges that are `close by in spatial locality`


## Theoretical guarantees on the false positive probability
MIDAS can give binary decisions upto a `user defined threshold`.

## MIDAS handle space time complexity using Count-Min-Sketch (CMS)
