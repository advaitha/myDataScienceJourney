# Approaches to Data privacy

## Identifying sensitive data
* Data which could be used separately or in combination with other information to identify a person or small group of persons
    * Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
    * Person-Related data
    * Proprietary and Confidential data


### Open source library to Identify PII Information
[Identifying PII in images and text](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio)


### Documenting data for use
* We can have a classification system for the data.
* Use classification as an initial step for documentation
* [Toolkit for documenting Data - Data Cards](https://sites.research.google/datacardsplaybook/)
* [Framework for documenting Models - Model Cards](https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/about)
* [Tool for Data Management](https://ckan.org/)
    * Documenting data Collection
    * Documenting Data Quality
    * Documenting Data Security
    * Documenting Data Privacy
    * Documenting Data Descriptions
    * [Documenting Data Statistics](https://github.com/PAIR-code/facets)
    * Documenting consent
* Track Data Lineage
* [Data version control](https://github.com/iterative/dvc)

## Pseudonymization
* It is a technique that allows us to use "Pseudonyms" instead of real names and data

![How a linkage attack works](/Images/linkage_attack.png)

* **Linking** is a primary attack vector to determine the identity of an individual.

![Advantages and Disadvantages of Pseudonymization](/Images/pseudo_ad_dis.png)

* If the data will be only used intenally by a small group of individuals who may require privileged access, then pseudonymization might be a good fit for the needs

* Tools for pseudonymization
