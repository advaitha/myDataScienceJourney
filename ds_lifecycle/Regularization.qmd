# Regularization


## Ridge Regression
* L2 regularization or squared 
* We add penalty term along with SSR to optimize

* Rigde regression does not make slope of any variable to zero
* If a variable is not very important then it's slope will be closer to zero and its parameter will be shrinked
* Ridge regression is useful when all the variables in a model are useful 


## Lasso Regression
* L1 regularization or absolute
* We add absolute value of the slope to the SSR to optimize
* The value of slope can become zero
* We can use lasso where unimportant variables are included in the model

**Use both Lasso and Ridge regression to get best of the both worlds**

* **Elastic Net** combines both types of regularization
