Data science specific orchestrators

* Airflow
* Argo
* Prefect

Scheduler is different from Orchestrator
Scheduler is high level - If schedulers are concerned with _when_ to run jobs and what resources are needed to run those jobs, orchestrators are concerned with _where_ to get those resources. Schedulers deal with job-type abstractions such as DAGs, priority queues, user-level quotas (i.e., the maximum number of instances a user can use at a given time), etc. Orchestrators deal with lower-level abstractions like machines, instances, clusters, service-level grouping, replication, etc. If the orchestrator notices that there are more jobs than the pool of available instances, it can increase the number of instances in the available instance pool.
