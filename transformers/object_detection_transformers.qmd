# Object Detection with DETR

* Non-maximum supression and anchor generation are not required

* They don't require customized layers

* DETR predicts all objects at once and is trained end-to-end with a set loss function which performs bipartite matching between predicted and ground-truth objects.

* Performs better on larger objects

* A segmentation head trained on top of a pre-trained DETR works on Panoptic segmentation

* No autogression in decoder

* Use transformers with parallel decoding

* Directly predicting the set of detections with absolute box prediction
