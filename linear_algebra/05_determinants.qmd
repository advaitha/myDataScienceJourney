# Determinants

## Singular and Non-Singular Transformations
* Linear transformations which are non-singular will cover the entire plane
* Linear transformations which are Singular will not cover the whole plane

## Determinant as an area

* For singular matrix the area of determinant is zero

## Determinant of a Product
* det(AB) = det(A)*det(B)
* ![Determinant of a product](/Images/determinant_of_product.png)
* The determinant of a product of singular and non-singular is zero, so AB will be singular

## Determinants of Inverses
* The determinant of an inverse matrix is the inverse of the determinant of the matrix
