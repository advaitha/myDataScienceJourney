# Solving linear Equations

## Matrix row-reduction
* To solve linear equation using traditional method, we use elimination. Similarly we use row reduction when using matrices to solve linear equations

## Row operations 
* Row operations preserve the singularity of the matrix i.e singular matrix will be singular and non-singular matrix will be non-singular after row operations
* row operations are -
  * switching rows
  * Multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar
  * Adding a row to another row

## The Rank of a Matrix
* It is a measure of the information that matrix or its corresponding system of linear equations is carrying
* Matrices with reduced rank will take less space for storage

* There is a relationship between Rank of a Matrix and its solution space.
* Rank = number of rows in a matrix - Dimension of solution space
* A matrix is non-singular if and only if it has full rank. The number of rows is equal to the rank of the matrix

## Row Echelon Form of a Matrix
* ![Calculations to get Row Echelon Form](/Images/row_form.png)
* Rank of a matrix is the number of 1's in the diagonal of row echelon form (for the below figure)
