# Introduction

* A system can be either `singular` or `non-singular`
* If the system is redundant or contradictory then it is singular
* IF the system carries as many pieces of information as sentences then it is a `complete` system, which is called `non-singular`
* We can measure how redundant a system is using `Rank`

## System of linear equations

* If the system does not carry enough information then it can have infinite solutions

* The constants does not matter when it comes to determine if the system is singular or non-singular. We can consider the constants as zero to make the equations simpler
