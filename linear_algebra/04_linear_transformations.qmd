# Linear Transformations

## Matrix - Vector multiplication as a Linear Transformations

*![Matrices as a Linear Transformations](/Images/matrices_as_linear_transforms.png)
* Basis cover the entire plane

* To get the matrix from original and transformed vectors, we only need information for two vectors [0,1] and [1,0] (see the image below)

## Matrix Multiplication
* We can see matrix product as multiplying two matrix and also as combining two linear transformations into a third linear transformation

## Indentiy Matrix
* It is the matrix when multiplied by any other matrix will give the same matrix
* Linear transformation by an Identity Matrix will leave the plane intact

## Matrix Inverse
* The product of a matrix and its Inverse should be an Identity matrix
* Inverse Matrix reverses the linear transformation of a matrix

* Non-singular matrices will have inverse and singular matrix will not have inverse
