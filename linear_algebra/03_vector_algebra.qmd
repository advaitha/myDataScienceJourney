## The dot product

* L2-norm = sqrt(dot product of a vector with itself)

## Geometric Dot Product
* Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero

* The sign of a dot product of two vectors can be either positive, zero or negative. If the dot product is positive it is because the projection of one vector on to the other is in the same direction. If the dot product is negative then the projection of a vector on the other is in opposite direction
