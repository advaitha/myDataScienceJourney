# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

## Bases
* ![Basis](/Images/bases.png)   
* The main property of a `Basis` is that every point in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of elements in the basis
* ![Valid Basis](/Images/valid_bases.png)
* ![Invalid Basis](/Images/invalid_basis.png)


## Span
* The span of a set of vectors is simply `the set of points that can be reached by walking in the direction of these vectors in any combination`
* ![Span of a vector](/Images/span.png)
* A basis is a minimal spanning set
