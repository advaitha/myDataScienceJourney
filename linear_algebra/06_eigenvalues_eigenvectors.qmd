# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

## Bases
* ![Basis](/Images/bases.png)   
* The main property of a `Basis` is that every point in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of elements in the basis
* ![Valid Basis](/Images/valid_bases.png)
* ![Invalid Basis](/Images/invalid_basis.png)


## Span
* The span of a set of vectors is simply `the set of points that can be reached by walking in the direction of these vectors in any combination`
* ![Span of a vector](/Images/span.png)
* A basis is a minimal spanning set

* ![Number of elements in the basis is the dimension](/Images/basis_dimensions.png)
  

  ## Eigenbases
  * Some basis are more useful than others
  * `Eigenbases` - A special way of linear transformation with respect to a basis that sends a parallelogram to another parallelogram with sides parallel to the original one. The basis is streched in the two directions (in the below case) which is called eigenbasis
  * <span id="highlighted-line">In the linear transformation, the two vectors in the basis are called Eigenvectors and the streching factor are called Eigenvalues</span>
