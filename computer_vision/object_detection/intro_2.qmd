* Using sliding window for object detection. choosing the window size is a challenge
* Region Proposal Netword - use traditional image processing techniques to come up with proposals for objects in the image. This is very fast. Selective search algorithm gives 2000 region proposals in a few seconds on CPU. Use convolutions on the proposed regions

* Detection without proposals
